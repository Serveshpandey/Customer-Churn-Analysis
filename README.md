# Customer-Churn-Analysis
📉 Customer Churn Analysis – Power BI Dashboard  This project focuses on analyzing customer churn patterns to help businesses understand why customers leave and how to improve retention strategies. Using Power BI, I designed an interactive dashboard that transforms raw customer data into clear, actionable insights.
Tools & Techniques

Power BI → Dashboard design, interactive reporting

Power Query (M) → Data cleaning & transformation

DAX → KPI calculations, churn metrics, and time intelligence

Excel / SQL → Data preprocessing and exploration

🔑 Key Insights

✔️ Churn Rate Analysis – Identified overall churn percentage and tracked it across demographics and time periods.
✔️ Customer Segmentation – Pinpointed high-risk groups based on tenure, service usage, and payment behavior.
✔️ Service Impact – Found correlations between specific services (e.g., internet, add-ons) and higher churn probability.
✔️ Revenue at Risk – Quantified potential financial loss due to customer churn, enabling proactive retention efforts.
✔️ Retention Opportunities – Highlighted customer groups with high churn but strong revenue contribution, guiding where retention campaigns should focus.

📈 Conclusion

The analysis revealed that:
Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn.
Certain services/packages have a higher churn rate, suggesting product-level improvements are needed.
Payment methods and contract types play a crucial role — customers on month-to-month contracts showed significantly higher churn compared to long-term subscribers.
Targeted retention strategies for high-value at-risk customers can reduce churn and increase profitability.

✨ This project demonstrates how data storytelling with Power BI can uncover deep business insights, helping organizations predict churn, retain customers, and boost long-term growth.
